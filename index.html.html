<h3> <a href="http://www.uscatholic.org/articles/200806/who-framed-mary-magdalene-27585">Mary Magdalene </a></h3>
<p> One of the most controversial members of Jesus's group. Her story started in the bible with a crowd of people trying to stone her to death, for being a whore. 
Jesus come saves her by saying one of his most <q> Let those without sin, cast the first stone. </q> The most obscure part about Mary Magdalene is that in the original 
story of the Bible she wasn't a whore. Mary was a normal person, the reason it says she was a prostitute in Bible is because during one of the many translations, it was too
confusing to keep track of all the women and the various ordeals they went through, so an author put them all as one person, and made Mary the combination. </p>

<h3> <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+20">10 Commandments </a></h3>
<p> The 10 commandments known as the Decalogue is a set of rules given by God himself. These rules were given to Mosses when and were scribbed on tablets. The tablets have
been lost with time, however they are supposedly in the arc of the covenent, but the arc of the covenent is also lost with time. There is a hole temple in a mountain range that claims 
to have both, hidden away. They are a set of rules that have been interpreted in many ways, some for good, some for the worse. Following these rules was said to be the quickest way to get
to heaven, but if you failed at one, you have to go and repent. To die with sin will either put you in purgatory to attone for them, or if you committed many grave sins hell to pay
for them the rest of your spiritual lives.</p>
